## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mtcars, 
       aes(x = mpg, y = hp, 
           col = as.factor(cyl))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_minimal()
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
